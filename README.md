## Widgets 

The AppState for each package using `redfire` is required to use RedFireState as a mixin.

When using widgets from `redfire`, a type parameter of the store's state must be used, ie. Widget<RedFireAppState>.  This is so that the parameterised StoreConnector<AppState, Output> can find the StoreProvider<RedFireAppState>.
