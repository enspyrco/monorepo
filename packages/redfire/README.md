Firstly, we promise this tedious nonsense will be automated away ASAP, but for now:

- [Setup your Firebase project]
- [Configure local settings]
- [Configure platform targets]
- [Add required code]
- [Setup Auth providers]
- [Add helper methods]
- Optionally also:
  - [Setup GitHub project]
  - [Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions]
  - [Install Redux DevTools]

</details>

## Playing with redfire

- ... what else?
