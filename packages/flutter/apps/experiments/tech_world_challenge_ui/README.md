# tech_world_challenge_ui

*A separate app to experiment with coding challenges for tech_world.*

I pulled this out into a separate app as we're playing around & experimenting
while also continuing to work on the rest of tech_world - doing the
experimenting in the tech_world app adds unnecesary complexity to both endeavours.
