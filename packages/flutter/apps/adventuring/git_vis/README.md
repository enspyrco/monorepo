# git_vis

*A Flutter app to visualise the git commit history with a delightful UI for performing git commands.*

We have re-implemented a tiny fraction of git so we can walk the commit tree, re-creating the relevant structure and details in-memory as a CommitTree object. We are now working on visualising the commit tree by drawing on a Flutter canvas.
