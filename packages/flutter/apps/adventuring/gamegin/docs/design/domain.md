Where does levels, score etc. live - they could be simulacrons but that seems wrong - maybe there is another abstraction such as “Interpretation” or “Game Story” (perhaps Story has Mechanics ? ) so the overall narrative is the story and things like levels are story mechanics… yeah that feels good

Story mechanics can have input to the simulation so a Simulacron might have a strength attribute which gets increased because a level (story mechanic) changed

Love it

Physics could be generalised to Simulation -> Laws so a particular simulation has a set of physical laws and… what other laws?

What about NPCs… Simulacrons?

Story can make changes to Clock in order to advance time
