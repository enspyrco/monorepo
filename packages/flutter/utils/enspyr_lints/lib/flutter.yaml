# prefer_relative_imports
# 
# reason:
#  - There are reasons for both package and relative imports
#  - Effective Dart says relative: https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/usage#prefer-relative-import-paths
#
#
# avoid_relative_lib_imports
# reason:
#  - Effective Dart says so: https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/usage#dont-allow-an-import-path-to-reach-into-or-out-of-lib
