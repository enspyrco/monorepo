# get_google_api_credentials

A Dart CLI app to obtain credentials for accessing Google APIs.

Running `dart run bin/get_credentials.dart` will output a link that a user can follow to obtain credentials (access & refresh tokens).

Currently the app is only for getting credentials that allow setting a watch on the user's GMail, but this will be expanded over time.
