# process-articles-in-emails

*A Dart microservice that processes & saves articles in emails.*

Assumptions:

- The microservice will be run on Cloud Run
- Emails are being pushed to the microservice as PubSub messages, for example see:
  - [Connect a PubSub topic to Cloud Run]
  - [Connect your GMail to a PubSub topic]

The server app is built using [Shelf], and is ultimately run inside a [Docker] container on [Cloud Run].

For info on prototyping, testing & deploying see:

- [Run & debug a shelf server locally]
- [Deploy a shelf server to Cloud Run]
- [Test a shelf server that runs on Cloud Run]
